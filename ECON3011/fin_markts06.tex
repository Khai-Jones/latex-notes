\lecturetitle{6}{Financial Markets and Institutions}

Financial markets and institutions form the backbone of modern economies, facilitating the flow of funds between savers and borrowers. Financial institutions, particularly banks, play a crucial role in this process. However, their operations inherently involve various risks that must be carefully managed to ensure profitability, stability, and the overall health of the financial system. Key risks include interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. Effective risk management, often guided by regulatory frameworks like the Basel Accords, is paramount. This note explores these core concepts, focusing on risk management strategies and the regulatory landscape.


\subsection{The Balance Sheet of a Commercial Bank}

A bank's balance sheet provides a snapshot of its financial position at a specific point in time. It adheres to the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital (Equity).

\subsubsection{Key Components}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assets (Uses of Funds):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reserves:} Vault cash held by the bank plus deposits held at the central bank. Required for meeting depositor withdrawals and regulatory requirements.
        \item \textbf{Securities:} Holdings of debt instruments like government bonds (e.g., Treasury securities) and municipal bonds. These provide income and can be sold for liquidity.
        \item \textbf{Loans:} The primary source of bank income. Includes commercial loans (to businesses), real estate loans (mortgages), and consumer loans (credit cards, auto loans). They represent the largest asset category but also the main source of credit risk.
        \item \textbf{Other Assets:} Physical assets such as buildings, equipment, and software.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Liabilities (Sources of Funds):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Checkable Deposits:} Funds held in accounts that allow depositors to write checks or use debit cards (e.g., demand deposits, NOW accounts). These are typically low-cost funds for the bank but can be withdrawn on demand.
        \item \textbf{Nontransaction Deposits:} Interest-bearing deposits with limited check-writing features, such as savings accounts and time deposits (Certificates of Deposit - CDs). They are generally a more stable source of funding than checkable deposits.
        \item \textbf{Borrowings:} Funds borrowed from other banks in the federal funds market, loans from the central bank (discount loans), or other sources like issuing debt.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capital (Bank Equity)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The net worth of the bank, representing the difference between total assets and total liabilities.
        \item Acts as a crucial buffer to absorb losses from bad loans or other risks, protecting depositors and creditors.
        \item Regulatory requirements mandate minimum capital levels (capital adequacy).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Banking Operations and Management}

Banks engage in several core activities to generate profit while managing inherent risks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Profit Generation:} Banks primarily earn income from the \textbf{interest rate spread} â€“ the difference between the interest earned on assets (like loans and securities) and the interest paid on liabilities (like deposits and borrowings).
    \item \textbf{Liquidity Management:} Ensuring the bank has sufficient liquid assets (cash and easily sellable securities) to meet depositor withdrawals and other immediate obligations. If facing a shortfall, a bank might:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Borrow from other banks (federal funds market).
        \item Sell securities from its portfolio.
        \item Borrow from the central bank (discount window).
        \item Call in loans (less common) or reduce new lending.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asset Management:} Managing the bank's assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Key strategies include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Diversifying the loan portfolio across different types of borrowers and industries.
        \item Holding sufficient liquid assets.
        \item Carefully assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers before granting loans.
        \item Actively managing interest rate risk exposure.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Liability Management:} Managing the sources of the bank's funds. This involves:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Attracting stable, low-cost deposits.
        \item Utilizing short-term borrowings strategically when needed.
        \item Managing the interest rate sensitivity of liabilities relative to assets.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Capital Adequacy Management:} Maintaining sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel III).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Higher capital increases a bank's safety and stability but can reduce shareholder returns (ROE).
        \item Key metrics include Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $ROA = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Assets}}$
                \item $ROE = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Equity Capital}}$
            \end{itemize}
        \item The relationship $ROE = ROA \times \text{Equity Multiplier}$ (where Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Equity Capital) shows how leverage (higher multiplier) can increase ROE, but also increases risk.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-Balance-Sheet Activities}

Banks increasingly engage in activities that do not appear directly on the traditional balance sheet but generate fee income and potentially significant risks. Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loan Commitments:} Promises to lend funds to a firm up to a certain amount (lines of credit).
    \item \textbf{Derivatives Trading:} Dealing in financial contracts (swaps, options, futures) whose value is derived from an underlying asset or rate. Used for hedging or speculation.
    \item \textbf{Securitization:} Pooling loans (e.g., mortgages) and selling them as securities to investors.
    \item \textbf{Fee-Based Services:} Investment banking, wealth management, brokerage services.
\end{itemize}
These activities boost earnings but can expose banks to complex risks (e.g., counterparty risk, operational risk, market risk).

\subsection{Risk Management in Financial Institutions}

Managing risk is central to banking. The main types of financial risks faced are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.

\subsection{Interest Rate Risk Management}

\subsubsection{Understanding Interest Rate Risk}
Interest rate risk arises from fluctuations in market interest rates. It impacts a financial institution's:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Earnings:} Changes in rates affect the interest income from assets and interest expense on liabilities, impacting the net interest margin (NIM).
    \item \textbf{Asset Values:} The market value of fixed-income assets (like bonds and fixed-rate loans) moves inversely to interest rate changes. Rising rates decrease the value of existing fixed-rate assets.
\end{itemize}
Since banks profit from the spread between asset yields and liability costs, managing this risk is crucial for profitability and stability.

\subsubsection{Measuring Interest Rate Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gap Analysis:} Measures the difference (gap) between rate-sensitive assets (RSA) and rate-sensitive liabilities (RSL) over a specific period.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Positive Gap (RSA > RSL):} Profits may increase if interest rates rise, as assets reprice faster or more significantly than liabilities.
            \item \textbf{Negative Gap (RSL > RSA):} Profits may decrease if interest rates rise, as liability costs increase faster than asset yields.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Duration Analysis:} Measures the sensitivity of the market value of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Duration represents a weighted average time until cash flows are received.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Longer duration assets/liabilities are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
            \item Banks aim to manage the duration gap (Duration of Assets - Duration of Liabilities, weighted by value) to limit the impact of rate changes on the bank's net worth.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convexity Analysis:} Refines duration analysis by accounting for the non-linear relationship between bond prices and interest rates, providing a more accurate risk assessment, especially for larger rate changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Strategies to Mitigate Interest Rate Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asset-Liability Management (ALM):} Adjusting the composition and maturity structure of assets and liabilities to balance interest rate sensitivity (e.g., matching the duration of assets and liabilities).
    \item \textbf{Using Derivatives:} Employing financial instruments to hedge against rate movements:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Interest Rate Swaps:} Exchanging fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments (or vice versa) with another party.
            \item \textbf{Futures Contracts:} Locking in a future interest rate for buying or selling a financial instrument.
            \item \textbf{Options, Caps, and Floors:} Providing protection against adverse rate movements beyond certain levels. Caps limit the maximum rate paid on liabilities; floors set a minimum rate received on assets.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Liquidity Risk Management}

\subsubsection{Understanding Liquidity Risk}
Liquidity risk is the risk that a financial institution may not be able to meet its short-term financial obligations (like depositor withdrawals or loan demands) as they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.

\subsubsection{Techniques for Managing Liquidity Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Holding Liquid Assets:} Maintaining sufficient reserves (cash) and holding high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), such as government securities, that can be easily sold without significant loss of value.
    \item \textbf{Liability Management:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Establishing contingency funding plans (CFPs) for potential stress scenarios.
            \item Diversifying funding sources (deposits, borrowings, equity).
            \item Relying more on stable, long-term funding sources rather than volatile short-term deposits or borrowings.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Liquidity Ratios and Monitoring:} Tracking key regulatory ratios:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):} Requires banks to hold enough HQLA to cover net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period (Basel III).
            \item \textbf{Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):} Promotes longer-term funding stability by requiring a minimum amount of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of assets and off-balance-sheet activities over a one-year horizon (Basel III).
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Central Bank Liquidity Support:} Accessing the central bank's discount window or other emergency lending facilities as a lender of last resort.
\end{itemize}
Maintaining a balance between liquidity (safety) and profitability (investing in higher-yielding but less liquid assets like loans) is a key challenge.

\subsection{Credit Risk Management}

\subsubsection{Understanding Credit Risk}
Credit risk (or default risk) is the possibility that borrowers (individuals or corporations) will fail to repay their loans or meet other contractual obligations, leading to financial losses for the lender. This is often the most significant risk for commercial banks due to the large proportion of loans in their assets. Poor credit risk management was a major factor in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

\subsubsection{Evaluating Credit Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Credit Scoring Models:} Using statistical models based on borrowers' past repayment history, financial ratios (e.g., debt-to-income), and other characteristics to assess creditworthiness.
    \item \textbf{Risk-Based Pricing:} Charging interest rates on loans that reflect the assessed credit risk of the borrower (higher risk borrowers pay higher rates).
    \item \textbf{Loan Portfolio Diversification:} Spreading loans across different industries, geographical regions, and types of borrowers to avoid concentration risk (large losses from problems in one sector).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Strategies to Mitigate Credit Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collateral Requirements:} Requiring borrowers to pledge assets (e.g., property for a mortgage) as security for a loan, reducing the potential loss severity if default occurs.
    \item \textbf{Credit Derivatives:} Using instruments like Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to transfer credit risk to another party (though this introduces counterparty risk).
    \item \textbf{Loan Covenants:} Including conditions in loan agreements that borrowers must meet (e.g., maintaining certain financial ratios).
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance and Capital Buffers:} Holding sufficient capital as required by regulations (like Basel Accords) to absorb unexpected credit losses.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stress Testing and Capital Adequacy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stress Testing:} A simulation technique used by banks and regulators to assess how a bank's financial position (especially capital levels) would fare under severe adverse economic or financial market scenarios (e.g., deep recession, sharp interest rate hikes, market crashes). This helps evaluate resilience to credit, market, and liquidity shocks.
    \item \textbf{Capital Adequacy Requirements:} Regulatory mandates (primarily from Basel frameworks) that require banks to maintain minimum capital levels relative to their risk-weighted assets (RWAs). This ensures banks have a sufficient buffer to absorb losses and remain solvent during financial distress, protecting the financial system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Regulatory Frameworks: The Basel Accords}

International regulatory standards, primarily the Basel Accords developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), play a crucial role in governing bank risk management and capital adequacy.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basel I (1988):} Introduced the concept of risk-weighted assets and set minimum capital requirements (initially 8\% of RWAs), focusing primarily on credit risk. Aimed to reduce banking failures and level the international playing field.
    \item \textbf{Basel II (2004):} Enhanced risk measurement techniques. Introduced three pillars:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Minimum Capital Requirements (refined risk weights, included operational risk).
            \item Supervisory Review Process (ensuring banks have sound internal processes and adequate capital beyond the minimum).
            \item Market Discipline (enhancing disclosure to allow market participants to assess bank risk).
        \end{enumerate}
        Required banks (especially larger ones) to hold capital more proportional to their actual risk exposures, allowing sophisticated internal models for risk assessment.
    \item \textbf{Basel III (Post-2008 Crisis):} Significantly strengthened global banking regulations in response to the financial crisis. Key enhancements include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Higher and better-quality capital requirements (increased minimum common equity Tier 1 capital).
            \item New capital conservation and counter-cyclical capital buffers.
            \item A minimum leverage ratio (non-risk-based backstop).
            \item Introduction of global liquidity standards (LCR and NSFR).
            \item Measures to address systemic risk posed by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Importance of Regulatory Compliance:} Compliance ensures institutions remain solvent, boosts depositor and investor confidence, helps maintain overall financial stability, prevents excessive risk-taking, and reduces systemic risk (the risk of failure spreading through the financial system).

\subsection{Comparison with the Insurance Sector}

While banks and insurance companies are both financial intermediaries, they have distinct business models, balance sheet structures, and risk profiles, leading to different focuses in financial stability assessments.

\subsection{Key Differences: Banking vs. Insurance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Risk Focus:} Banks focus heavily on credit risk (loan book quality) driven by the real economy. Insurers focus more on market risk (investment yields) and insurance-specific underwriting risks (life, non-life, health).
    \item \textbf{Balance Sheet Structure:} Banking is asset-driven (loans). Insurance is liability-driven; assets primarily exist to back future policyholder claims (technical provisions).
    \item \textbf{Business Cycle:} Insurance involves an inverted production cycle â€“ premiums are collected upfront for coverage provided later.
    \item \textbf{Time Horizon:} Insurers typically operate with a much longer time horizon than banks, especially life insurers with long-duration liabilities.
    \item \textbf{Liabilities Nature:} Insurance liabilities (technical provisions) are often complex to estimate, depending on actuarial assumptions and future events.
    \item \textbf{Liquidity Risk:} Generally less critical for insurers (especially life insurers) than for banks due to more predictable outflows and lack of demand deposits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stylized Balance Sheet and Regulation (Solvency II)}
European insurance regulation (Solvency II) provides a framework analogous to Basel for banks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Economic Balance Sheet:} Values assets and liabilities on a market-consistent basis.
    \item \textbf{Technical Provisions (Liabilities):} Represent the amount needed to settle future obligations to policyholders. Composed of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Best Estimate Liability (BEL):} Present value of expected future cash flows using risk-free rates.
            \item \textbf{Risk Margin (RM):} Additional amount reflecting the uncertainty of the BEL, calculated using a cost-of-capital approach.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Own Funds (Capital):} Assets minus Technical Provisions. Must be sufficient to cover regulatory capital requirements.
    \item \textbf{Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR):} Capital required to absorb significant losses, calibrated to ensure solvency over a one-year period with a 99.5\% confidence level (Value-at-Risk concept). Covers underwriting, market, credit, and operational risks.
    \item \textbf{Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR):} An absolute floor below the SCR. Breach triggers intensive regulatory intervention.
\end{itemize}
