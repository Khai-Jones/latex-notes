\noindent Here are some questions based on Chapter 9 of Growth Theory (11th Edition): 

\noindent Conceptual Questions:
\itenum{ 
   \item How does population growth affect the steady-state level of income in the Solow model? 
   \item What is the role of technological progress in sustaining economic growth according to the Solow model? 
   \item Why does the Solow model assume that technological progress and population growth are exogenous? 
   \item What is labor-augmenting technological progress, and how does it impact economic growth? 
   \item How does the efficiency of labor influence the production function in the Solow model? 
   \item Why does the steady-state growth rate of output per worker depend solely on the rate of technological progress? 
   \item What is the Golden Rule level of capital in the Solow model with both population growth and technological progress? 
   \item How does the marginal product of capital net of depreciation relate to the growth rate of output in the Golden Rule steady state? 
   \item What are the key differences between exogenous and endogenous growth theories? 
   \item How does endogenous growth theory attempt to explain persistent economic growth? 
}

\section*{solutions} 

Population growth decreases the level of income in the Solow Model. 
The role of technological progess in sustaning economic growth is to increase the amount of produced with the same level of inputs.

\noindent Application-Based Questions 
\itenum{
   \item How does the Solow model explain the difference in income per worker between countries with high and low population growth rates? 
   \item Suppose an economy experiences an increase in its rate of technological progress. What are the short-run and long-run effects on output per worker? 
   \item How would a decrease in the rate of depreciation affect the steady-state levels of capital and output in the Solow model? 
   \item According to the Solow model, why might countries with similar savings rates and population growth rates have different levels of income per worker? 
   \item How does the concept of creative destruction explain the rise and fall of industries over time? 
   \item If technological progress is assumed to be endogenous, what factors might influence its rate of  growth?
   \item How does the process of research and development (R\&D) contribute to economic growth in endogenous growth models? 
   \item In what ways does Schumpeterâ€™s theory of creative destruction differ from the traditional Solow model?

\noindent Mathematical and Graphical Analysis 
\itenum{ 
   \item Derive the equation for steady-state consumption per worker in the Solow model with population growth and technological progress. 
   \item Given a Cobb-Douglas production function, show how population growth affects the steady-state level of income per worker. 
   \item Graphically illustrate how an increase in the population growth rate shifts the steady-state capital per worker in the Solow model. 
   \item Using the equation, explain why capital per effective worker converges to a steady state. 
   \item How does the endogenous growth model differ mathematically from the Solow model in terms of returns to capital? 
   \item What does the Solow model predict about the relationship between the marginal product of capital and the steady-state growth rate of income? 
   \item Would you like more specific types of questions, such as case studies or numerical problems?
