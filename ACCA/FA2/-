\section{Accounting for Business Transactions}



The Financial Accounting syllabus introduces five business activities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Selling Goods or Services: This can involve immediate payment from customers (Cash Sales) or a promise of payment at a later date (Credit Sales). 
    \item Customer Returning Goods: When customers bring back items they bought (Sales Returns).   
    \item Buying Goods or Services:  This can involve paying immediately with cash (Cash Purchases) or promising to pay later (Credit Purchases). 
    \item Returning Goods to Suppliers: When our business sends back items we bought (Purchase Returns). 
    \item Small Cash Payments: Handling minor, everyday expenses using a special small cash fund (Petty Cash transactions). 
\end{itemize}

Each of these business transactions goes through a consistent three-step process. Firstly, when a business transaction takes place, it creates a source document. This document acts as an original piece of evidence for the transaction. 

Secondly, this source document is used to write down the transaction in a journal entry. The journal entry is a chronological diary where every business transaction is initially recorded. In this entry we figure out what specific accounts (like `Cash', `Sales Revenue', or `Accounts Payable') are affected and whether they need to increase or decrease.  This is important because for each transaction, *at least* two accounts will be affected. One will be debited and at least one will be credited for the exact amount. 

Lastly, after a journal entry is made, its details are posted to the affected individual ledger accounts. Each individual ledger account resides within a document called the general ledger. A simple way to think of this is as a binder, where each page is an individual ledger account and the binder is the general ledger account. When an entry is *posted*, we simply take the debit and credit amounts from the journal entry and apply them to the correct sides of their respective individual accounts in the general ledger. This updates the balance of each account, so we always know how much money we have, how much customers owe us, what our expenses are, and so on.
