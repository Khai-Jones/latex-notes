\section{Capital Structure and Finance Costs}


If a company issus 60,000 new shares with a par value of \$1 each 
to existing shareholders at \$1.60 per share, what is the correct 
double entry?

Cash = $60,000 \cdot \$1.60 = \$96,000$

Share Capital = $60,000 \cdot \$1 = \$60,000$

Share Premium = $\$96,000 - \$60,000 = 36,000$
